            <strong>1. How many blades are best for ceiling fans?</strong>
         </h2>
         <p>Three blades are standard because they offer good aerodynamics, but that configuration can generate wind chop in some models. Five blades are best in such instances.</p>

            <strong>2. Why is the remote control turning on and off?</strong>
         </h3>
         <p>Interruption or the remote tuning into another frequency may be the reason for the malfunction. Ensure no two remotes in the house are on the same frequency.</p>

            <strong>3. Why is the ceiling fan making a clicking sound?</strong>
         </h2>
         <p>Loose parts are the most usual causes of clicking sounds on ceiling fans. The mounting mechanisms might not be properly secured, or a screw/nut might be loose.</p>
         <h2>
            <strong>4. Can one remote control more than one fan?</strong>
         </h2>
         <p>It is possible for a remote to operate multiple ceiling fans. However, doing this comes with a risk of interfering with the frequency.</p>
         <h2>
            <strong>5. Can you get a custom-sized downrod?</strong>
         </h2>
         <p>Most brands will have downrods in standard sizes, but you can have it cut to the best size for your fan installation.</p>
         <h2>
           <strong>6. Why is the fan humming but not spinning when turned on?</strong>
         </h2>
         <p>This problem arises from a faulty capacitor. A spoilt capacitor will allow power to reach the fan but not starting the motor.</p>
         <h2>
            <strong>7. Do ceiling fans lose their speed over time?</strong>
            <img src="../CT_US/sun1.png" alt="" width="400" height="200">
         </h2>
         <p>Yes. The best way to tell if a fan needs replacing is to check the speed. Reduced speed may not be noticeable right away, but the air circulation will change.</p>
         <h2>
            <strong>8. Can you use a light fixture from a different brand?</strong>
         </h2>
         <p>Some ceiling fans have screws in the middle section of the motor casing that make it possible to attach a light fixture from another manufacturer. However, review the compatibility of the lighting with the fan.</p>
         <h2>
            <strong>8. Can you use a light fixture from a different brand?</strong>
         </h2>
         <p>If it's a wet ceiling fan, meaning that it will be exposed to the element, then yes, you have to get a weather-resistant light fixture.</p>
         <h2>
            <strong>10. Why does the light on the fan come on then turn off?</strong>
         </h2>
         <p>Some ceiling fans have wattage limits, meaning that using a bulb that exceeds it will cause a malfunction.</p>
